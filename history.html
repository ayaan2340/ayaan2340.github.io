                                The United States has the highest incarceration rate in the world. It has 5% of the world's population, but 25% of the world's prison population.
                                Before the 1970s, growth of the prison population was predicted to decline in the future; however, the prison population has grown exponentially since the 1970s.
                                
                                <br></br>
                                The motivation behind mass incarceration is the same motivation behind slavery and Jim Crow laws: racial control. During slavery, the limitation of opportunities
                                for black people was direct as slaves were not regarded as people but property. This meant that black people could not vote, own land, or have access to jobs.
                                After slavery was abolished in 1865, wealthy elites in the South were worried about the loss of their labor force. They created the Black Codes, which were
                                designed to work around the abolishment of slavery when trying to keep the systems of oppression in place. Sharecropping, grandfather clauses, and poll taxes
                                were all new systems that were more discrete in hiding the racial control that was still in place. However, the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Voting Rights Act
                                of 1965 were passed, which made these systems of discrimination illegal.
                                <br></br>
                                Structural racism against black people did not disappear after 1964 though. The new systems of racial control were "colorblind" and even more discrete than their predecessors.
                                Instead of condemning black people directly, politicians and wealthy elite would use the War on Drugs and crime to attack black people. The War on Drugs was a campaign
                                started by Richard Nixon in the 1970s in retaliation to the social progress gained by African Americans in the 1960s. It was a campaign that declared drug abuse as "public enemy
                                number one", but failed to come up with new policies to limit drug use. On the other hand, it focused on increasing the number of arrests and the severity of punishment
                                for drug-related crimes. Therefore, the War on Drugs could be seen as a way to filter out the poor and minorities from society by targeting
                                low-income neighborhoods and increasing policing and arrests in those neighborhoods. Even though different races and social classes use drugs at similar rates,
                                minorities and poor people are more likely to get arrested than upper-class white people.

                                Michelle Alexander writes in her book <a href="https://newjimcrow.com/">The New Jim Crow</a>
                                , "The surge of public concern [about drugs] did not correspond to a dramatic shift in illegal drug activity,
                                but instead was the product of a carefully orchestrated political campaign. The level of public concern about Drugs
                                was only weakly correlated with actual crime rates, but highly correlated with political initiatives, campaigns, and partisan appeals".
                                These subtle hints to race allowed for the public support for get tough on crime policies in the 1980s that have lasting impacts today.
