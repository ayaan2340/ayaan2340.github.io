# Criminal Justice Crisis Website
 This is a website I built to explain the issue of mass incarceration in the United States using data visualizations I created in Tableau and based on my understanding of [The New Jim Crow: Mass Incarceration in the Age of Colorblindness](https://newjimcrow.com/) by Michelle Alexander.

 ## Implementation
 * Found datasets that described disparities in drug arrests between various races and the demographics and population growth of correctional facilities in the United States from the 1960s-present day.
 * Visualized the data using Tableau including bar and line graphs
 * Added commentary that explains why the graphs show disparities in prison populations and drug arrests, and explained how this continues to affect the rights and welfare of low-income, diverse communities today
 * Styled the website using Bootstrap and linked the uploaded Tableau graphs using the Tableau API
 * Added sources and credits
